  This function is usually called in a loop, where the caller is responsible
  for providing new input when INFLATE_INPUT is returned, and emptying the
  output buffer when INFLATE_OUTPUT is returned, until INFLATE_DONE is
  returned to indicate end of input, or INFLATE_ERROR if an error occurs.

   The inflate algorithm reads from buf[pos] (for input buffers) or writes to
   buf[len] (for output buffers) and then increments pos. The caller typically
   has to reset pos to zero (or a different value) to reuse a buffer.
